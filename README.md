# Lexical-analyzer
A simple Lexical Analyzer that reads a source code file and tokenizes it into identifiers, integers, operators, and parentheses. It classifies characters, generates tokens, and outputs each token's type and lexeme. This project forms the foundation for building compilers or interpreters.
